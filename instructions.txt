=== FT_PRINTF TESTER ===

1. INSTALLATION
---------------
Ensure that the folder of this tester ("printf_tester") is located INSIDE the root of your ft_printf project.

Correct structure:
/ft_printf_root
    ├── Makefile
    ├── ft_printf.h
    ├── *.c (your source files)
    └── printf_tester/       <--- YOU ARE HERE
          ├── launch.sh
          ├── main.c
          ├── checker.py
          └── mandatory_tests/

2. FIRST RUN
------------
Grant execution permissions to the script:
$ chmod +x launch.sh

3. USAGE COMMANDS
-----------------
The tester supports different modes and optional integration with Valgrind.

> Fast Execution (Without Valgrind):
  ./launch.sh          -> Runs MANDATORY tests
  ./launch.sh m        -> Runs MANDATORY tests
  ./launch.sh b        -> Runs BONUS tests

> Execution with Memory Check (Valgrind):
  Add "val" as a parameter to activate memory leak checking.
  
  ./launch.sh val      -> MANDATORY + Valgrind
  ./launch.sh m val    -> MANDATORY + Valgrind
  ./launch.sh b val    -> BONUS + Valgrind

4. RESULTS LEGEND
-----------------
[OK]   : The printed output and the return value (ret) are identical to the original printf.
[KO]   : There is a discrepancy. The script will show the difference between ORIG and USER.

If Valgrind is active:
[MOK]  : Memory OK. No leaks and no invalid memory access errors.
[MKO]  : Memory KO. Leaks, invalid read/write, or uninitialized variables found.

Happy debugging!
