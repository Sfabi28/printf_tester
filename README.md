# ft_printf Tester

![Last Commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/Sfabi28/printf_tester?style=for-the-badge&color=red)

A comprehensive and strict tester for the 42 **ft_printf** project. It supports both Mandatory and Bonus parts, includes memory leak detection via Valgrind, and generates detailed logs for debugging.

## 📁 1. Installation

Ensure that the folder of this tester (`printf_tester`) is located **INSIDE** the root of your `ft_printf` project.

**Correct Directory Structure:**
```text
/ft_printf_root
    ├── Makefile
    ├── ft_printf.h
    ├── *.c (your source files)
    └── printf_tester/       <--- YOU ARE HERE
          ├── launch.sh
          ├── README.md
          ├── CHANGELOG.md
          ├── test_result.log
          └── srcs
```

**Important:** To avoid accidentally committing the tester to your repository, add `printf_tester/` to your `.gitignore` file:

```bash
echo "printf_tester/" >> .gitignore
```

Ensure that the path is right and set a proper timeout time **INSIDE** the `launch.sh` file

```text
   SOURCE_PATH="../"
   TIME=3 (valgrind has x3)
```

## ⚙️ 2. Usage Commands
-----------------
The tester supports different modes and optional integration with Valgrind.

```text
Command,Description
./launch.sh,Runs ALL tests (Mandatory + Bonus).
./launch.sh m,Runs MANDATORY tests only.
./launch.sh b,Runs BONUS tests only.

Command,Description
./launch.sh val,Runs ALL tests with Valgrind checks.
./launch.sh m val,Runs MANDATORY tests with Valgrind.
./launch.sh b val,Runs BONUS tests with Valgrind.
```

## 📊 3. Results Legend
-----------------
```text
[OK]   : The printed output and the return value (ret) are identical to the original printf.
[KO]   : There is a discrepancy. Check the log file for details.

If Valgrind is active:
[MOK]  : Memory OK. No leaks and no invalid memory access errors.
[MKO]  : Memory KO. Leaks, invalid read/write, or uninitialized variables found.
```

## 📝 4. Debugging with Logs
-----------
```text
Test ID: 87 [Bonus #] -> KO
   ORIG Str: '  0xa'       <-- What printf printed
   USER Str: '0x    a'     <-- What your ft_printf printed
   ORIG Ret: 5             <-- Return value of printf
   USER Ret: 7             <-- Return value of ft_printf
```
Happy debugging!🖥️
